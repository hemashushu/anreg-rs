# ANREG

_ANREG_ is a brand new regex language that offers all the capabilities of traditional regex but in much simpler form.

Designed with user-friendliness in mind, _ANREG_ requires no prior knowledge to get started and can be seamlessly converted to and from traditional regex.

(Note: ANREG is short for _XiaoXuan Regular Expression_)

[anreg-rs](https://github.com/hemashushu/anreg-rs) is a lightweight engine (interpreter) for ANREG.
